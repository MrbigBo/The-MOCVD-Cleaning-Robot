ROS packages, including actionlib, message_generation, roscpp, movit_core, and others. 
Developed custom packages to implement critical functionalities such as RRT path planning and velocity planning.

The communication between hardware components primarily involves serial communication between ROS and STM, as well as CAN communication between STM and the driver. 
To enhance the reliability of the serial communication, we also incorporated CRC-16 checksum.
